**TD;LR** *My simple workflow to create and publish content, from any device, for free, using Joplin, GitHub Desktop and GitHub Pages.*

### Requirements
- Free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) Account.
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/download/) Free opensource note-taking app.
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Optional)
- Domain Name (Optional)

### Overview
Creating new Joplin content and exporting it in your (local) GitHub Pages repository as md-markdown. This will allow you to use GitHub Desktop to commit / push the new / updated content to your GitHub Pages Repository. Either for immediate publication, or for Ci validation prior to publication.

### Configuration
The configuration was very simple using the following documentation links.
- [GitHub Pages - Quick Start](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
- [GitHub Pages - Adding Custom Domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) (Optional)

The only poorly documented area, was adding a custom domain to GitHub Pages.

**Note**: This requires a CNAME "and A records" creating in the DNS portal of your custom domain name provider.
