**TD;LR** *A simple workflow to create and publish content, from any device, for free, using Joplin, GitHub Desktop and GitHub Pages (a.k.a jekyll).*

### Requirements
- Free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) Account.
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/download/) Free opensource note-taking app.
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Optional)
- Domain Name (Optional)

### Overview
Creating new Joplin content and exporting it in your (local) GitHub Pages repository as md-markdown will allow you to use GitHub Desktop to commit and push new, or updated content to your GitHub Pages repository.

### Configuration
Configuration was very simple using the following documentation links.
- [GitHub Pages - Quick Start](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
- [GitHub Pages - Adding Custom Domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) (Optional)
- [Jekyll - Step by Step](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

**Note**: The only poorly documented area, was adding a custom domain to GitHub Pages. This requires a CNAME "and A records" creating in the DNS portal of your custom domain name provider.
